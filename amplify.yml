# This is the build specification file for AWS Amplify Hosting.
# It defines how to build and deploy your frontend application.

version: 1
# The version key is required and should be set to 1.
# It defines the version of the Amplify build spec syntax we're using.

frontend:
  # The frontend section contains all the instructions for building your frontend app.
  
  phases:
    # Phases define the different stages of your build process.
    
    preBuild:
      # The preBuild phase runs before the main build command.
      # It's typically used for installing dependencies and setting up the environment.
      commands:
        - echo "Installing dependencies..."
        - npm ci
        # npm ci is preferred over npm install for CI environments as it's more deterministic.
    
    build:
      # The build phase is where your main build command runs.
      commands:
        - echo "Building the application..."
        - npm run build
        # This assumes you have a "build" script defined in your package.json
        # Adjust this command if your build script has a different name.
    
    postBuild:
      # The postBuild phase runs after the build is complete.
      # You can use this for tasks like running tests or preparing artifacts.
      commands:
        - echo "Build completed on `date`"
        # This is just an example. Add any post-build steps you need here.

  artifacts:
    # The artifacts section defines what files should be deployed.
    
    baseDirectory: dist
    # This should be the directory where your build output is located.
    # For a Vite project, this is typically 'dist'.
    
    files:
      - '**/*'
      # This pattern means "include all files and directories".
      # You can be more specific if you need to exclude certain files.

  cache:
    # The cache section allows you to specify paths to be cached between builds.
    # This can significantly speed up subsequent builds.
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
      # Caching node_modules can speed up installations in future builds.

# Environment variables can be set in the Amplify Console and accessed during the build.
# Do not put sensitive information directly in this file.
# Example of how to use an environment variable:
# - echo "API Key: $API_KEY"

# Note: Make sure any environment variables you need (like VITE_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY)
# are properly set in the Amplify Console's environment variables section.
